# Eddie2 – Detailed Feature Breakdown

## 1. Core Features

### 1.1 Chat Interface
- **User Story**: As a user, I want a familiar chat-like layout with a sidebar for quick navigation and a main pane for the conversation, so I can manage multiple chats easily.

  - "Recent Chats" in the sidebar for quick switching.
  - "View All" opens a comprehensive chat list.

- **Key Points**:
  - Secure API key storage.
  - Error handling for API issues.
  - Response formatting.

### 1.3 File Attachment
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to attach a single file for the AI to analyze or reference, so I can get context-based answers.
