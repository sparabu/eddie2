# Eddie2 UI/UX ‚Äì Extended Interactions & Advanced Flows

This document builds on the interaction patterns in [EDDIE_UIUX_SPEC_MAIN.md](./EDDIE_UIUX_SPEC_MAIN.md), offering more detailed or edge-case flows. It also outlines certain QA or administration processes.

---

## 1. Complex or Less Common User Flows

### 1.1 Chat with Multiple File Uploads
- **Implementation Status**: 
  - Multiple images: ‚úÖ Implemented
  - Multiple documents: ‚è≥ Planned (Post-MVP)

#### Current Implementation (Images)
1. User clicks the "Attach" button in the chat input.
2. File picker dialog opens supporting multi-select for images.
3. User selects multiple image files (jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif).
4. System validates each image (size, format).
5. Preview thumbnails appear in the input area showing all selected images.
6. User types a message (optional).
7. User clicks the send button.
8. Message with all image attachments is sent to the AI.
9. Images appear in a grid layout in the user's message bubble.
10. AI response references and analyzes all images content.

#### Planned Implementation (Documents)
1. Multiple document file support will be added in future updates.
2. Will include similar UI patterns adapted for document previews.
3. If any file is invalid, show error while preserving the valid ones.

### 1.2 Merging Q&A Pairs
- Potential future feature: user merges multiple Q&A pairs into one.  
- Could appear as a batch action in the Q&A screen.

### 1.3 Bulk Deletion of Chats/Q&A
1. User selects multiple items (checkbox or multi-select).  
2. Click "Delete All."  
3. Confirmation dialog with item count.  
4. On success, user sees "N items deleted."

---

## 2. QA & Testing Considerations

### 2.1 Manual Tests
- **Theme Switching**: Ensure UI updates instantly for both light/dark.  
- **Language Switching**: Confirm strings reload, no leftover text.  
- **Offline Mode**: Disconnect network mid-chat; does the system queue messages or show offline banner?

### 2.2 Automated Tests
- **Widget Tests**: For UI components (Sidebar, ChatInput, etc.).  
- **Integration Tests**: Full flows (login ‚Üí open chat ‚Üí send message ‚Üí sign out).  
- **Golden Tests**: Check layout stability with different screen sizes & languages.

### 2.3 Performance Profiling
- **Startup Time**: Evaluate how quickly the main screen loads.  
- **Memory Use**: For large chat histories.  
- **API Latency**: Possibly measure round-trip time to OpenAI.

---

## 3. Admin or Moderator Flows (Optional)

### 3.1 Admin Q&A Editing
- Admin might override user data or delete items that violate terms.  
- Special admin UI or same UI with elevated permissions.

### 3.2 Remote Chat Monitoring
- If an institutional version is needed, an admin might watch multiple user chats in real time.  
- Requires strong privacy disclaimers and user consent.

---

## 4. Detailed Edge Cases

### 4.1 Chat Title Collisions
- If user's first message is identical across multiple new chats, you might have repeated chat titles.  
- Possibly append numeric suffix or date/time.

### 4.2 Q&A Pair with No Answer
- Some AI responses might yield a question but no answer.  
- Save as partial Q&A? Show a warning?

### 4.3 Setting an Invalid API Key
- Show user-friendly error: "Invalid key format."  
- Provide a link or tooltip to help them obtain a proper key.

---

## 5. Future Interaction Ideas

- **Drag-and-Drop** Chat Reordering  
- **Pin Important Chats**  
- **Q&A Tagging** & advanced filtering  
- **Batch Export** Q&A pairs as CSV or JSON  
- **In-app Notifications** for real-time updates

---

## 8. Image Attachment Interaction

### 8.1 Attaching Images to Chat Messages

#### Single Image Flow
1. User clicks attachment button in the chat input
2. File picker dialog opens showing supported image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif)
3. User selects an image file
4. System validates the image (size, format)
5. If valid, a preview of the image appears in the input area
6. User types a message (optional)
7. User clicks send button
8. Message with image attachment is sent to the AI
9. Image appears inline in the user's message bubble
10. AI response references the image content

#### Multiple Image Flow
1. User clicks attachment button in the chat input
2. File picker dialog opens showing supported image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif)
3. User selects multiple image files (multi-select is supported)
4. System validates each image (size, format)
5. If valid, previews of all selected images appear in the input area in the same order as selected
6. User types a message (optional)
7. User clicks send button
8. Message with all image attachments is sent to the AI, preserving the exact order as selected by the user
9. Images appear in a grid layout in the user's message bubble
   - First image (in user's selection order) is displayed prominently
   - Additional images are shown in a grid below the main image, maintaining the original selection order
10. AI response references and analyzes all images content in the order they were submitted

#### Error Handling
- If image is too large: Error message indicating the size limit
- If format is unsupported: Error message listing supported formats
- If image fails to load after sending: Error placeholder with descriptive message
- For web platform: Warning about temporary nature of attachments when errors occur
- For multiple images: Individual validation with indication of which images failed

#### Web Platform Considerations
- Web file data is persisted to localStorage for improved experience
- File data is keyed by a unique identifier
- Files can be accessed across page refreshes (up to 10 most recent files)
- Multiple image files are individually stored and tracked
- Error states include instructions about session limitations

#### Animation & Transitions
- Smooth fade-in of image previews
- Loading state when processing large images
- Subtle scale animation when attaching images
- Grid layout animation when displaying multiple images
- Error messages appear with brief fade-in

#### Component Interactions
- **MessageBubble** component displays images with appropriate formatting
  - Handles single and multiple image layouts adaptively
  - Provides grid layout for multiple images
- **ErrorPlaceholder** component shows when images fail to load
- **FileService** handles persistence of web file data
- **OpenAIService** processes and includes all images in API requests
