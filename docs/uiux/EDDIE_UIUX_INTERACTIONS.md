# Eddie2 UI/UX – Extended Interactions & Advanced Flows

This optional doc builds on the interaction patterns in [EDDIE_UIUX_SPEC_MAIN.md](./EDDIE_UIUX_SPEC_MAIN.md), offering more detailed or edge-case flows. It also outlines certain QA or administration processes.

---

## 1. Complex or Less Common User Flows

### 1.1 Chat with Multiple File Uploads (Post-MVP)
1. User sees an "Attach" button with multi-file support.  
2. Possibly an in-chat file preview list.  
3. On send, each file is base64-encoded and included in the prompt or a separate API call.  
4. If any file is invalid, show error while preserving the valid ones.

### 1.2 Merging Q&A Pairs
- Potential future feature: user merges multiple Q&A pairs into one.  
- Could appear as a batch action in the Q&A screen.

### 1.3 Bulk Deletion of Chats/Q&A
1. User selects multiple items (checkbox or multi-select).  
2. Click "Delete All."  
3. Confirmation dialog with item count.  
4. On success, user sees "N items deleted."

---

## 2. QA & Testing Considerations

### 2.1 Manual Tests
- **Theme Switching**: Ensure UI updates instantly for both light/dark.  
- **Language Switching**: Confirm strings reload, no leftover text.  
- **Offline Mode**: Disconnect network mid-chat; does the system queue messages or show offline banner?

### 2.2 Automated Tests
- **Widget Tests**: For UI components (Sidebar, ChatInput, etc.).  
- **Integration Tests**: Full flows (login → open chat → send message → sign out).  
- **Golden Tests**: Check layout stability with different screen sizes & languages.

### 2.3 Performance Profiling
- **Startup Time**: Evaluate how quickly the main screen loads.  
- **Memory Use**: For large chat histories.  
- **API Latency**: Possibly measure round-trip time to OpenAI.

---

## 3. Admin or Moderator Flows (Optional)

### 3.1 Admin Q&A Editing
- Admin might override user data or delete items that violate terms.  
- Special admin UI or same UI with elevated permissions.

### 3.2 Remote Chat Monitoring
- If an institutional version is needed, an admin might watch multiple user chats in real time.  
- Requires strong privacy disclaimers and user consent.

---

## 4. Detailed Edge Cases

### 4.1 Chat Title Collisions
- If user's first message is identical across multiple new chats, you might have repeated chat titles.  
- Possibly append numeric suffix or date/time.

### 4.2 Q&A Pair with No Answer
- Some AI responses might yield a question but no answer.  
- Save as partial Q&A? Show a warning?

### 4.3 Setting an Invalid API Key
- Show user-friendly error: "Invalid key format."  
- Provide a link or tooltip to help them obtain a proper key.

---

## 5. Future Interaction Ideas

- **Drag-and-Drop** Chat Reordering  
- **Pin Important Chats**  
- **Q&A Tagging** & advanced filtering  
- **Batch Export** Q&A pairs as CSV or JSON  
- **In-app Notifications** for real-time updates

## 6. Image Attachment Interaction

### 6.1 Attaching Images to Chat Messages

#### User Flow
1. User clicks attachment button in the chat input
2. File picker dialog opens showing supported image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif)
3. User selects an image file
4. System validates the image (size, format)
5. If valid, a preview of the image appears in the input area
6. User types a message (optional)
7. User clicks send button
8. Message with image attachment is sent to the AI
9. Image appears inline in the user's message bubble
10. AI response references the image content

#### Error Handling
- If image is too large: Error message indicating the size limit
- If format is unsupported: Error message listing supported formats
- If image fails to load after sending: Error placeholder with descriptive message
- For web platform: Warning about temporary nature of attachments when errors occur

#### Web Platform Considerations
- Web file data is persisted to localStorage for improved experience
- File data is keyed by a unique identifier
- Files can be accessed across page refreshes (up to 10 most recent files)
- Error states include instructions about session limitations

#### Animation & Transitions
- Smooth fade-in of image preview
- Loading state when processing large images
- Subtle scale animation when attaching images
- Error messages appear with brief fade-in

#### Component Interactions
- **MessageBubble** component displays the image with appropriate formatting
- **ErrorPlaceholder** component shows when images fail to load
- **FileService** handles persistence of web file data
- **OpenAIService** processes and includes images in API requests
